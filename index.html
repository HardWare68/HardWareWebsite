    <h1>Hi, I'm Alex Post.</h1>
    <p>I'm Alex Post, a current student at the University of Toledo. I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Data Science with a Specialized Concentration in Computer Science.</p>

    <p>My time at Chick-fil-A allowed me to work on my communication and leadership skills. While there, I partook in the Chick-fil-A Leadership Development Program, which prepared me for managing teams effectively. I also coached various new hires on job processes, ensuring smooth operation of the restaurant. Finally, I perfected my communication skills to make sure that the kitchen had the food it needed when it needed it!</p>

    <p>However, I still have experience in lots of other languages! Node.JS, Java, and Python are some of the languages I also have experience with.</p>
